# Wave Energy at the Local Scale using Wave Watch 3 Global Wave Data

This repository contains various scripts to develop an understanding of wave energy at local scales. Input data is in the form of Wave Watch 3 model output, a 3rd generation wave model developed by Tolman and is freely available for processing.

In our process we are extracting from the global model (approximately 50 x 50 km resolution) with a 3 hour time step from two data products available from NOAA.
